## Database Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Create a `documents` table with the following schema:

```sql
create table documents (
  id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  file_name text not null,
  extracted_text text not null
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
alter table documents enable row level security;

-- Create policy to allow users to see only their documents
create policy "Users can view their own documents"
  on documents for select
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);
